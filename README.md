# INET-Labb

This project was created as an assignment for a course in Internet Socket programming. The game and server might be a 
little buggy, so no need to stress test it, I will not go back and fix this game.

The game is a bad recreation of famous games such as "Playing With Fire" and "Bomber Man". 
However, I had great fun during this project, and learned a lot about servers and sockets while creating the game.

## To run the game

You need to run one instance of the "Server" class (inside the server folder) and two instances of the "Main" class.
In order to do this, you might need to allow parallel run in your configurations.

Important that the server is started first.

While only one player or client has pressed start, the server will wait for another connection. You cannot play the game
solo, you need to have two clients running at the same time. Easiest is just to have it on one computer, but I only made
one set of key-binds, so you need to switch between the two screens in order to control the two dragons separately. 
Meaning, even tho the game is two player, you can't really play with your friend on the same computer.

## Credits

This whole project was created by me: Ludwig Franklin. I wrote all the code and painted all the tiles and the dragons
as well as the bombs etc.
